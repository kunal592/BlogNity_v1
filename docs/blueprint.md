## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6750A4) for a sophisticated and modern feel, inspired by themes of knowledge and premium access.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E0EA), a desaturated tint of the primary purple, creating a soft and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted blue (#49777D), an analogous color to the purple, offering a contrasting, sophisticated call-to-action.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, that ensures excellent readability and a contemporary feel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel for headlines.
- Use Lucide React icons for a consistent and clean look across the platform.
- Premium SaaS layout with sidebar navigation that hides on toggle. Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Smooth transitions via Framer Motion for all UI elements. Use toasts for all success operations (like, follow, bookmark, etc.).




## problems to fix:
#only implement/improve logics dont edit alter UI and other logic of the project.


- check comment section, if user comment on blog it should list there wihout manual refreshing the site.

- search bar is not working.

- implement serch user feature in this project.

- check the self follow and remove it user should not follow herself.

- on profile section, at edit the updated values/data from user is not working means user enter updated avtar and bio but it doesnot reflect in there profile.

- one user one view: now at dasboard total views counter there is a count of views where i want that if a user view a blog (ntimes) it's view count should be taken 1 only no more from that user at a blog.
